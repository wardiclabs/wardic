Wardic imports Effect's `Atom` and `AtomRegistry` by their own paths, not through the `effect/reactivity` barrel. A dev server pre-bundles dependencies without tree-shaking, so the barrel carried Effect's HTTP and RPC code into every app's development build: about 0.5 MB less there now (Vite's pre-bundled chunk for a Solid 2 app with `domMax`, 2.0 → 1.5 MB). A production build ships the same code as before.
